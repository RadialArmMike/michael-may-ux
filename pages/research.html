    <h3 class="center">PROCESS MAPS</h3>
      <p class="tag">research, design ops</p>

      <p>The above map of UnitedHealthcare's claims adjudication process was first created in a collaborative session with team members from project architecture, project managements, leadership, UX, and operations. To my knowledge, it was the first time an end-to-end screen flow of this core operations process had been mapped.</p>

      <h4>Story</h4>

        <p>Many of us became so familiar with this process that it’s difficult now to see the need for a map at all. But early in the FOX Claims project, few outside of operations staff knew exactly what screens and in what order were required for claim adjudication. I shared this simple map of adjudication with many resources over the next few years – Training, POs, BAs, developers and newer UX staff. After I’d added the updated screen designs, even Operations staff and leadership became avid consumers of this map. It effectively illustrated:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>that claim adjudication as a process was largely unchanged,</li>
          <li>the few places where the process was different, and</li>
          <li>that screens' look would change dramatically, but their content would not.</li>
        </ol>

        <img src="../images/research-adj-map-simple-1272.jpg" alt="claim adjudication map showing correlation between old and new systems"/>
        <p class="image-caption">Early Map - This map of claim adjudication was created to highlight the one-to-one relationship between old and new UI screens.</p>

        <p>Eventually this “simple map” became the basis for more detailed mappings, which showed navigational pathways, shortcut use, spur trails off of the main adjudication process for tasks like research and validation, and even helped us identify inconsistencies between closely related screens.</p>

        <img src="../images/research-adj-map-complex-1272.jpg" alt="claim adjudication map showing primary and secondary navigational paths"/>
        <p class="image-caption">Mid-Project Map - This screenflow helped us consolidate navigational paths between the core adjudication screens and common spur trails off the core process.</p>

        <p>After launch, this map was again the backbone for a diagram of potential production enhancements, by illustrating where they occurred in the adjudication process. This allowed us to see at a glance which enhancements might be target screens which were expected to be replaced in the short term anyway, heading off effort which might be overhauled too quickly to produce acceptable ROI.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Post-Launch Map - Once the claims system was in use, attention turned to optimizizing production under the new system. UI, behavioral and process enhancements were identified and mapped back to the adjuication process.</p>

        <p>This screen flow has been the most heavily used artifact I created at UHC. Each later version was made possible by the one that came before. And it all began with the simple map.</p>

  <h3 class="center">PERSONAS</h3>
    <p class="tag">research, visual</p>
    <p>When I came to UHC one of the first things I wanted was to understand the user base. My first steps were to identify user roles, schedule interviews and create personas.</p>

    <h4>One Application, Many Roles</h4>

      <p>The big project at the time of my hire was a rebuild of a 30-year-old claim processing system, and there were 12 or more user roles interacting with it, with no clear definition of the different needs between roles. Many processed claims. Others were underwriters. Some accessed the software to answer questions with a member live on the phone. These, in particular, were critical to Net Promoter Scores, as they carried on regular verbal conversations with members. And yet we hadn’t yet formally defined their needs in the system.</p>

      <p>Research tasks were touchy because of prior UX research efforts which operations leadership came to view as a heavy tax on daily production. Early in the process there had been a team of 8 researchers mapping the system, and they had pulled production user into SME roles without much regard to how that might affect everyday operations. So I had to be careful, polite, and time box my interview requests carefully, usually in 1-hour blocks, scheduled around the needs of operation teams and individual users.</p>

      <p>Raw materials for each persona were collected with a templated interview, with room for improvisation. Questions included:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Which applications do you use most often?”</li>
        <li>“What data do you need most frequently?”</li>
        <li>“How many people share your role?”</li>
        <li>“Do team members move between roles often? If so, what are the common migration patterns?”</li>
      </ul>

      <img class="no-border" src="../images/research-personas-layout-1272.jpg" alt="several claims processing personas"/>
      <p class="image-caption">I gathered raw materials for each persona in under an hour by templatizing an interview script with a few open-ended questions for improvisation. We covered Jobs To Be Done (JTBD), role-specific behaviors and most needed apps/screens/data. As time allowed, I recorded each role’s core processes with a user-narrated walkthrough video and then turned each of these into a screen-by-screen process map in Miro.</p>

      <p>Eventually we expanded personas to map the top work processes for each. Each persona was linked to corresponding process maps and narrated video of the user explaining the hows and whys of their work. These have proved incredibly valuable for onboarding new staff, since many talented engineers, analysts, product owners and other specialists come to us without an insurance background.</p>

      <p class="tag">research, design ops, visual</p>

      <p>I created these process maps for my second major application project at UHC. The software being researched in this case is used for membership intake and maintenance. It is used by a much wider range of roles, and called for the creation of six new personas.</p>

      <h4>Process</h4>

        <p>A natural extension of working with a more diverse user population was identifying core processes for the new roles. While personas and video walkthroughs accounted for the first two phases of research, these process maps allowed me to generate PHI-free artifacts that could be widely circulated among project teams.</p>

        <p>On these second generation maps, I added related data, including other applications in use, transitions between those apps, efficiency- and pain-points, links to the narrated video source material and a list of most commonly used screens by role.</p>

        <img src="../images/research-process-map-ap0-1272.jpg" alt="all core process maps involving membership management software for appeals role"/>

        <p class="image-caption">Notice that two screens are shown for each step. This because nearly all production staff employ a two-monitor workspace setup. The window that’s populated for each step shows where the user’s attention is. </p>

        <p>One benefit of having created role-based mapping was seeing a few common sub-processes surface across roles. We used the maps to identify and prioritize these paths, and later refined them with competing page layouts and usability testing.</p>
